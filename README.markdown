MAKERFACTORY
===========

MAKERFACTORY is a web application designed to connect people who want
things made with people who want to make things. Check it out at
[makerfactory.com](http://www.makerfactory.com). 

Downloading and installing
--------------------------
MAKERFACTORY is a Rails 2 app. We use Bundler.Â After cloning the
repository, run:

    bundle install

Get started by loading the database schema:

    rake db:schema:load

And launching the application:

    script/server

A Capistrano deploy script is included, but you will likely need to make
changes for your own environment.
