MAKERFACTORY
===========

MAKERFACTORY is a web application designed to connect people who want
things made with people who want to make things. Check it out at
[makerfactory.com](http://www.makerfactory.com). 

Downloading and installing
--------------------------
MAKERFACTORY is a Rails 3 app. We use Bundler.Â After cloning the
repository, run:

Get started by loading the database schema:

A Capistrano deploy script is included, but you will likely need to make
changes for your own environment.
